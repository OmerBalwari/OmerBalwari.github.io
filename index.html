<h1 style="color:tomato">Story of Railway station</h1>

<p>Once upon a time I was at Mumbai, Maharshtra. I was walking on Railway station. Suddenly one guy came and told me that I stole his purse, but actually I didnt stole anything </p>

<p> Then he went on police. He told them, I stole his purse. Police asked him for proof and evidence, but actually I didn't steal anything. Therefore he couldn't been able to proove me wrong. Hence I got free from police!. </p>
